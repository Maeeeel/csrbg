# csrgb
Silly config making your hud and crosshair rgb.

## How to install it
You simply have to download [here](https://github.com/Maeeeel/csrbg/releases/tag/buh/),
then put it in your config folder. It should be located somewhere like
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg
```
After that, you will be able to execute via the console by typing ``` exec csrgb.cfg ```

Have fun with it !

### ! AZERTY keyboard !
If you have an AZERTY keyboard this probably wont work so I advise you to download this [one](https://github.com/Maeeeel/csrbg/releases/tag/guh/).
